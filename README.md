# Book Tracker App

Simple Android app for tracking books you've read, are reading, or plan to read. Built as part of a university project while learning Android development.

## Overview

The app lets you organize books into three categories:
- **Read**
- **Currently Reading**
- **Plan To Read**

Each book can include details like the title, author, notes, and status-specific info (dates, ratings, progress, etc.).

## Features

- Add/edit/delete books
- Tabbed layout for easy navigation
- Clean, minimal UI
- Sample books included

## Tech Stack

- Java
- Android Studio
- Gradle
- No database — data is in-memory only

## Notes

This was mainly a learning project, so there are some limitations:
- Data isn’t saved after closing the app
- UI is basic but functional
- App is in Serbian
